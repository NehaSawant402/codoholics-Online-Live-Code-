This project involves developing an online collaborative code editor using web technologies.The system will enable real-time collaboration among remote software development teams,
allowing multiple developers to simultaneously edit and view code. It will support the compilation and execution of code within the editor itself.
One of our most popular features is the live code sharing feature, which allows users to collaborate on code in real-time. 
This is especially useful for remote team collaboration and makes it easier for users to work together on coding projects regardless of their location
In addition, our programming language playground provides an environment for users to practice programming languages like Java, Python(Flask), Ruby, C, C++, and more. This feature is perfect for beginners
who want to learn how to code in a safe and supportive environment.our online community provides a platform for users to connect with other coders, share knowledge, and collaborate on coding projects. Our community is an inclusive and supportive space
where individuals of all levels can share their experiences and learn from one another. Our goal is to make coding a more inclusive and collaborative experience for coders of all levels
